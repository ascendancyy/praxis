# Praxis

Built from [Soda Theme](http://buymeasoda.com/) by Ian Hill. Although at this point Praxis really isn't related, like we're not even cousins. That makes it okay, right?

## Installation

### Using Package Control

Coming soon (I hope).

### Using Git

If you're a git user, you can install the theme and keep up to date by cloning the repo directly into your `Packages` directory.

You can locate your `Packages` directory by going to: `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`.

While inside the `Packages` directory, clone the theme repository using the command below:

    git clone https://github.com/ascendancyy/praxis/ "Theme - Praxis"

### Manually

1. Download the files using the GitHub .zip download option
2. Unzip the files and rename the folder to `Theme - Praxis`
3. Find your `Packages` directory using the menu item  `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`
4. Copy the folder into your Sublime Text `Packages` directory

## Activating the theme

* Open your User Settings Preferences file: `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings - User`
* Add (or change) your theme entry to be `"theme": "Praxis.sublime-theme"`

**Example Sublime Text 3 User Settings:**

    {
        "theme": "Praxis.sublime-theme"
    }
